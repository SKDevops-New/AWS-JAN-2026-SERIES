# AWS CloudWatch – EC2 Level Monitoring

## 1. What is CloudWatch?

CloudWatch is a monitoring service provided by Amazon Web Services.

It helps us:

* Monitor EC2 performance
* Create alarms
* Send notifications
* Trigger automated actions

In real production environments, CloudWatch continuously monitors infrastructure and reacts when thresholds are crossed.

---

## 2. Default Metrics Available for EC2

When we launch an EC2 instance, CloudWatch automatically collects the following metrics:

* CPU Utilization
* Network In
* Network Out
* Disk Read Operations
* Disk Write Operations
* Status Checks

Important:

By default, CloudWatch does NOT collect:

* Memory usage
* Disk space usage inside the operating system

---

## 3. Types of Monitoring in EC2

### Basic Monitoring

* Metrics updated every 5 minutes
* Enabled by default
* No additional cost

### Detailed Monitoring

* Metrics updated every 1 minute
* Additional cost
* Recommended for production environments

In production systems, detailed monitoring provides faster alert detection.

## 4. CloudWatch Alarm Concept

A CloudWatch alarm consists of three components:

Metric
Example: CPUUtilization

Threshold
Example: CPU greater than or equal to 80 percent

Action
Example: Send email, trigger Auto Scaling, invoke Lambda

Example scenario:

If CPU usage becomes 80 percent or more for 5 minutes, send email notification.

## 5. Step-by-Step: Create SNS Topic and Email Subscription

Before creating an alarm, we must configure SNS.

### Step 1: Create SNS Topic

1. Go to AWS Console
2. Search for SNS
3. Click Topics
4. Click Create topic
5. Select Standard
6. Name: ec2-alert-topic
7. Click Create

### Step 2: Create Subscription

1. Open the topic
2. Click Create subscription
3. Protocol: Email
4. Endpoint: Your email address
5. Click Create
6. Confirm the subscription from your email inbox

Now SNS is ready to send alerts.

---

## 6. Create High CPU Alarm (CPU >= 80%)

Scenario:

If CPU usage becomes 80 percent or more for 5 minutes, send email alert.

### Steps:

1. Go to CloudWatch
2. Click Alarms
3. Click Create alarm
4. Select Metric
5. Choose EC2
6. Select Per-Instance Metrics
7. Select CPUUtilization

Configure conditions:

* Threshold type: Static
* Whenever CPUUtilization is Greater than or equal to 80
* For 5 consecutive minutes

Attach SNS topic:

* Select ec2-alert-topic

Name the alarm:

High-CPU-80

Click Create alarm.

---

## 7. Practical Demo: Generate CPU Load

Login to EC2 instance.

Install stress tool:

```
sudo dnf install stress -y
```

Check number of CPUs:

```
nproc
```

Generate CPU load:

```
stress --cpu 2 --timeout 600
```

This will create CPU load for 10 minutes.

After 5 minutes, CloudWatch alarm state will change to ALARM and email notification will be triggered.

This is a good live demo scenario for training.

---

## 8. Create Low CPU Alarm (CPU <= 10%)

Scenario:

If CPU usage is less than or equal to 10 percent for 10 minutes, send alert.

Use cases:

* Detect idle servers
* Cost optimization
* Auto scale-in decision

### Steps:

1. Go to CloudWatch
2. Click Create alarm
3. Select CPUUtilization

Configure condition:

* Less than or equal to 10
* For 10 minutes

Attach SNS topic

Name:

Low-CPU-10

Click Create alarm.

## 9. EC2 Protection Settings (Important for Interviews)

### Stop Protection

Prevents stopping the instance from AWS Console.

If shutdown command is run from inside the operating system, instance will still stop.

---

### Termination Protection

Prevents terminating the instance from AWS Console.

Recommended to enable in production environments.

---

### Shutdown Behavior

When shutdown is initiated from OS level, what should happen?

Options:

* Stop (Default)
* Terminate

If set to Terminate, shutdown command will permanently delete the instance.

Be careful in production.

---

## 10. Real-Time Production Scenario

Example:

You are running:

* Java application
* Nginx
* Backend service

Suddenly CPU reaches 95 percent.

CloudWatch alarm triggers
SNS sends email
Auto Scaling launches new instance
Load Balancer distributes traffic

This is a real DevOps implementation scenario.
